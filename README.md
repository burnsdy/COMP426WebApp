# COMP426WebApp
This application will deliver delicious recipes to hungry college students based solely on the ingredients in their pantry.

_Dijkstra’s Alcoholism Final Project_

    Our web application will be used to help people come up with meal ideas based on the limited ingredients that they have access to in their dorm, apartment, or home pantry at any given time. They will use the search bar to look up and enter ingredients into their “online pantry.” Once they have finished updating their ingredients, the app will recommend the highest rated meals that can be made using these ingredients.
    For the required functionalities, the html input field will autocomplete common ingredient names when the user types them. Once users sign up and create accounts, the app will store their ingredients and can update them as they add or delete items from their online pantry. The backend of the app would be involved with retrieving recipes from a number of web sources, and users would additionally be able to rate and save their favorite recipes, or submit recipes of their own. The app will utilize one of the many public food-related APIs.
    The target audience of our web application is other college students, but the app would be useful to anyone who has a tight food budget or limited resources. With the app, users would be able to create delicious meals for themselves and realize their potential as amateur chefs.

_List of Tasks:_
Build the user interface for the web application, including the home page, user account page, stored/searched recipes page, and online pantry.
Develop a method for storing the ingredients associated with a user’s online pantry and the user’s frequently-used and highest-rated recipes.

Develop the backend of the app for retrieving recipes from various websites based on selected ingredients alone.
